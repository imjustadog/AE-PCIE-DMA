The default installation folder used by the Package and Deployment Wizard
keys off the Application title of the VB program.

Set this to Avnet\PCIe_Perf in the "Make" tab of the Project Properties.

This will install by default in C:\Program Files\Avnet\PCIe_Perf  ($AppPath), so you can
then add sub-folders from there to create different installation hierarchies for
different Avnet programs, if you wish.

Using this naming convention allows multiple programs to be installed under the
Program Files\Avnet hierarchy.
